    <h2>How to keep software and operating systems updated</h2>
    <p>For most modern devices, it’s easy to keep your apps or OS updated. Let’s look at two of the best ways to stay as up to date as possible:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Look for notifications:</b> The Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, Android and iOS devices, and Windows and Mac OS computers will tell you when an update is ready for installation. You might receive a push notification, see a flag or bubble on the store or settings icon, or may need to go into the update menu directly.</li>
        <li><b>Turn on automatic updates:</b> Almost every device will let you turn on automatic updates for apps and operating systems. This process can vary depending on your device, but a good place to look for these settings is in the device settings section or store settings. </li>
        </ul>

    <h2>FAQs about software updates</h2>
    <p>Have more questions about computer updates? We have answers.</p>

    <h3>What happens if I don’t update my software?</h3>
    <p>If you don’t update your software, you’re at greater risk of system problems, hackers, malware, and compatibility issues. Older versions are usually less efficient, meaning your computer runs slower and may struggle to multitask or handle RAM-heavy tasks like audio or video editing.</p>

    <h3>Are there any risks to updating software?</h3>
    <p>There are some risks to updating software and operating systems. Any new version of an app or OS is almost certain to contain some security vulnerabilities. And if you have an older device, newer software might malfunction due to new hardware requirements. Even with those potential risks, the security and performance benefits of updated software far outweigh the downsides.</p>
 
    <h3>How do I know if my software is up to date?</h3>
    <p>The easiest way to check if your software is up to date is to see if updates are available wherever you normally update your software. This usually means checking for Apple App Store or Google Play store updates. You can also usually find any available updates via your system settings.</p>
 
    <h3>What is the risk of running outdated software?</h3>
    <p>If you run outdated software, the known vulnerabilities in older versions of apps and operating systems mean you’re at a higher risk of being hacked. Additionally, your phone could run hotter, your device might fall prey to malware, and your computer may not run as smoothly as it could. </p>
