        <h2>How to secure mobile devices</h2>
        <p>Just as there are many different kinds of threats, there are many ways to reduce the likelihood of your device being impacted by one of them. With a few small changes, you can better secure your digital life and help keep different types of hackers and malware at bay. </p>

        <h3>Enable screen locks and biometrics for better in-person security</h3>
        <p>Built-in security features should be your first line of defense against physical device tampering and theft. Choose as difficult a passcode as you can easily remember, and don’t reuse any of your codes. Biometrics, like FaceID or fingerprint scanners, create an extra layer of security that is more difficult to hack than a password.</p>

        <h3>Keep your devices and apps up to date to limit vulnerabilities</h3>
        <p>An updated device is more secure than one running an older operating system or application. Turn on automatic updates to minimize the time your phone is vulnerable to known threats.<b></b></p>

        <h3>Use secure networks and VPNs for safer browsing, shopping, and downloading</h3>
        <p>A VPN creates an encrypted path for you to use the internet by anonymizing your device and masking your IP address. Always protect your browsing when on public Wi-Fi by using a VPN.<b></b></p>

        <h3>Back up and encrypt data to protect your personal information</h3>
        <p>Backing up an encrypted copy of your data protects you in the event of malware disabling your mobile device. Encrypted cloud backups mean you can access your data anywhere and be nearly as safe as with encrypted physical backups.<b></b></p>

        <h3>Employ strong, unique passwords and 2FA to keep your accounts safer</h3>
        <p>Using a password manager will make securely storing and accessing passwords simple. Follow good password security practices by choosing unique passwords that you don’t reuse. Turn on two-factor authentication to put another roadblock between hackers and your personal information.<b></b></p>

        <h3>Use mobile security software for faster, more efficient mobile security</h3>
        <p>Mobile security software like Norton Mobile Security for Android and iOS devices combines many of these security features into an easy-to-use package. It scans your messages for phishing attempts, warns you when suspicious networks are nearby, and protects your devices from malware. </p>
