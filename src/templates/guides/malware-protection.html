        <p>{{ _('If your iPhone is acting unusually, it\'s important to determine if these behaviors are typical signs of a virus. It\'s possible that other factors, like hardware issues or bugs in the iOS operating system or an app, might be the culprit. In that case, a simple software update could help fix the issue.') }}</p>
        <p>{{ _('But, if your iPhone shows common virus symptoms, that’s a signal that you could be dealing with a malware infection. Here’s what to look out for:') }}</p>

        <h3>{{ _('Phone performance') }}</h3>

        <p>{{ _('Viruses also strain your phone’s processor and memory with additional tasks, hindering the efficient operation of other apps. That extra workload can lead to increased power consumption and can cause your device to overheat and the battery to drain more quickly.') }}</p>

        <h3>{{ _('Data usage') }}</h3>
        <p>{{ _('Malware on your iPhone can exploit your data connection for malicious activities. That may involve hijacking data-intensive apps, covertly downloading harmful code, or funneling your private information to other sources.') }}</p>

        <h3>{{ _('Third-party software') }}</h3>
        <p>{{ _('Discovering an unfamiliar app on your iPhone could indicate malware. Even if you installed the app, issues that emerge after installation could signal trouble. That is particularly true for apps from third-party sources or if your phone is jailbroken. Jailbreaking allows you to install apps outside of iOS\'s secured ecosystem, which can increase the risk of virus exposure.') }}</p>
        <p>{{ _('But even malicious apps have snuck into Apple’s App Store. If you notice persistent pop-ups or other suspicious app behavior, that may be a sign that malicious third-party software has infiltrated your iPhone.') }}</p>

        <p>{{ _('If all the above steps fail, and you still think your iPhone may have a virus, then it’s time to use an antivirus app to help detect malware on your phone. Norton 360 for Mobile checks for the latest security patches and iOS updates, filters spam texts to help protect against phishing attacks, and notifies you if you’re using a potentially unsafe Wi-Fi network.') }}</p>

        <p>{{ _('Running an iOS antivirus scan with a security app like Norton 360 for Mobile is an effective way to remove iPhone viruses.

        <p>{{ _('The first step is to wipe your iPhone clean of the most likely sources of infection. To do this, delete suspicious apps, particularly those you downloaded right before you noticed signs of an infection. To help remove lingering traces of malicious code, clear your app and browser caches, such as iMessage cookies.') }}</p>

        <h3>{{ _('Restart your iPhone') }}</h3>
        <p>{{ _('To help wipe the slate clean, restart your iPhone. Simply power off your phone, wait a few seconds after it finishes shutting down, and turn it on again. Restarting your device can help stop viruses from replicating and spreading further through iOS.') }}</p>

        <p>{{ _('To factory reset your iPhone, follow the same steps as above—the only difference is that you won’t be able to restore a backed-up version of your phone’s memory during the reboot.') }}</p>

        <h2>{{ _('Preventing iPhone viruses') }}</h2>
        <p>{{ _('Apple’s iOS has iPhone security features that make malware infiltration relatively rare. iPhones operate in a self-contained ecosystem, using only Apple’s programming and files and allowing app downloads only from the official App Store. That walled garden approach, combined with Apple’s extensive software security, makes it hard for malware to infiltrate.') }}</p>
        <p>{{ _('There’s no way to prevent all iPhone viruses, but there are basic and essential steps you can take to help shield your device from malicious software:') }}</p>

        <h3>{{ _('Don’t jailbreak') }}</h3>
        <p>{{ _('Sticking to the standard iOS configuration and not jailbreaking your phone reduces the chances that an iPhone virus infects your phone. iOS comes with built-in security features, and the company’s walled garden approach to software means that apps on the App Store are vetted before becoming available to download. Unless you have a good reason (e.g, you’re a researcher), you shouldn’t try to jailbreak your iPhone.') }}</p>

        <h3>{{ _('Stay alert to potential risks') }}</h3>
        <p>{{ _('Although iOS may be safer than other operating systems, no computing system is 100% secure—you also have a part to play. Take care not to open unknown, unexpected, or suspicious links you receive in emails or messages, even if they come from close friends or family. And make sure you use secure Wi-Fi networks and understand the risks of using public Wi-Fi.') }}</p>

        <h3>{{ _('Permissions and updates') }}</h3>
        <p>{{ _('Even if you trust all the apps on your iPhone, be careful about what permissions you give them. Being careful with the permissions you grant helps protect your private data if an app becomes compromised by malware.
