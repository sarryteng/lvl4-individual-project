        <h2>How to check for viruses on your iPhone</h2>
        <p>If your iPhone is acting unusually, it's important to determine if these behaviors are typical signs of a virus. It's possible that other factors, like hardware issues or bugs in the iOS operating system or an app, might be the culprit. In that case, a simple software update could help fix the issue.</p>
        <p>But, if your iPhone shows common virus symptoms, that’s a signal that you could be dealing with a malware infection. Here’s what to look out for:</p>

        <h3>Phone performance</h3>
        <p>If your iPhone's apps frequently crash or the device shuts down unexpectedly, a virus might be disrupting your phone's operations. That interference could affect task processing and negatively impact app functionality.</p>
        <p>Viruses also strain your phone’s processor and memory with additional tasks, hindering the efficient operation of other apps. That extra workload can lead to increased power consumption and can cause your device to overheat and the battery to drain more quickly.</p>

        <h3>Data usage</h3>
        <p>Malware on your iPhone can exploit your data connection for malicious activities. That may involve hijacking data-intensive apps, covertly downloading harmful code, or funneling your private information to other sources.</p>
        <p>Such actions can lead to a significant increase in your mobile data usage. That excess data usage may cause you to exceed your data limit and lead to a higher phone bill.</p>

        <h3>Third-party software</h3>
        <p>Discovering an unfamiliar app on your iPhone could indicate malware. Even if you installed the app, issues that emerge after installation could signal trouble. That is particularly true for apps from third-party sources or if your phone is jailbroken. Jailbreaking allows you to install apps outside of iOS's secured ecosystem, which can increase the risk of virus exposure.</p>
        <p>But even malicious apps have snuck into Apple’s App Store. If you notice persistent pop-ups or other suspicious app behavior, that may be a sign that malicious third-party software has infiltrated your iPhone.</p>

        <h3>Scan for viruses</h3>
        <p>If all the above steps fail, and you still think your iPhone may have a virus, then it’s time to use an antivirus app to help detect malware on your phone. Norton 360 for Mobile checks for the latest security patches and iOS updates, filters spam texts to help protect against phishing attacks, and notifies you if you’re using a potentially unsafe Wi-Fi network.</p>

        <h2>How to get rid of viruses on your iPhone</h2>
        <p>Running an iOS antivirus scan with a security app like Norton 360 for Mobile is an effective way to remove iPhone viruses. As well as helping you identity a virus or other malware infection on your iPhone, it can also help secure your iPhone in real time by blocking infections before they spread to your device.</p>
        <p>Keep reading and follow the methods below to learn how to remove iOS viruses and malware:</p>

        <h3>Clean up your device</h3>
        <p>The first step is to wipe your iPhone clean of the most likely sources of infection. To do this, delete suspicious apps, particularly those you downloaded right before you noticed signs of an infection. To help remove lingering traces of malicious code, clear your app and browser caches, such as iMessage cookies.</p>

        <h3>Restart your iPhone</h3>
        <p>To help wipe the slate clean, restart your iPhone. Simply power off your phone, wait a few seconds after it finishes shutting down, and turn it on again. Restarting your device can help stop viruses from replicating and spreading further through iOS.</p>

        <h3>Install the latest iOS</h3>
        <p>Whether or not the previous steps have managed to purge your iPhone of malware, installing the latest version of iOS will help prevent reinfections and help your phone more effectively quarantine viruses in your system.</p>
        <p>To update your iOS, go to <b>Settings</b> &gt; <b>General </b>&gt; <b>Software Update </b>and install any available software updates.</p>

        <h3>Restore from a backup or reset to factory settings</h3>
        <p>To manually remove more advanced and stubborn malware, you may have to restore your iPhone to a previously backed-up version from before the malware infection hit.</p>
        <p>You can restore a clean backup from iCloud by following these steps:</p>
        <p>1. Go to <b>Settings</b> &gt;<b> General</b> &gt; <b>Transfer or Reset iPhone</b>.<br /></p>
        <!-- insert image of step 1) -->
        
        <p>2. Select<b> Erase All Content and Settings</b>, <b>Erase Now</b>, and follow the on-screen prompts to continue.<br /></p>
        <!-- insert image of step 2) -->
        
        <p>3. During rebooting, your iPhone will show the <b>Apps &amp; Data</b> page, where you can<b> </b>select<b> Restore from iCloud Backup</b>.</p>
        <p>4. Sign into iCloud and choose the backed-up iOS version to restore.<br /></p>

        <p>If all else fails and you don’t have a backup to restore from, you should try performing a factory reset, which will <b>erase all the data from your device</b>. Along with purging any viruses, a factory reset will also wipe your photos, files, apps, and settings—so proceed accordingly.</p>
        <p>To factory reset your iPhone, follow the same steps as above—the only difference is that you won’t be able to restore a backed-up version of your phone’s memory during the reboot.<b></b></p>

        <h2>Preventing iPhone viruses</h2>
        <p>Apple’s iOS has iPhone security features that make malware infiltration relatively rare. iPhones operate in a self-contained ecosystem, using only Apple’s programming and files and allowing app downloads only from the official App Store. That walled garden approach, combined with Apple’s extensive software security, makes it hard for malware to infiltrate.</p>
        <p>There’s no way to prevent all iPhone viruses, but there are basic and essential steps you can take to help shield your device from malicious software:</p>

        <h3>Don’t jailbreak</h3>
        <p>Sticking to the standard iOS configuration and not jailbreaking your phone reduces the chances that an iPhone virus infects your phone. iOS comes with built-in security features, and the company’s walled garden approach to software means that apps on the App Store are vetted before becoming available to download. Unless you have a good reason (e.g, you’re a researcher), you shouldn’t try to jailbreak your iPhone.</p>

        <h3>Download apps only from the App Store</h3>
        <p>Apple’s App Store is the safest place to download the apps you need for your iPhone. Downloading or installing apps unverified third-party sources can increase the risk of exposing your device to iPhone malware.</p>

        <h3>Stay alert to potential risks</h3>
        <p>Although iOS may be safer than other operating systems, no computing system is 100% secure—you also have a part to play. Take care not to open unknown, unexpected, or suspicious links you receive in emails or messages, even if they come from close friends or family. And make sure you use secure Wi-Fi networks and understand the risks of using public Wi-Fi.</p>

        <h3>Permissions and updates</h3>
        <p>Even if you trust all the apps on your iPhone, be careful about what permissions you give them. Being careful with the permissions you grant helps protect your private data if an app becomes compromised by malware. It will also ensure that an app which turns out to be malicious will be less capable of spreading viruses to other apps on your iPhone.</p>

        <h2>Signs your Android phone may have a virus or other malware</h2>
        <p>Phones can be vulnerable to damage externally and internally. While the external damage is usually visible, internal damage is usually hidden from view.</p>
        <p>Malware like viruses is known to perform repeated tasks that can take up resources on your devices. Signs of malware may show up in these ways.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Your phone is too slow.</li>
                <li>Apps take longer to load.</li>
                <li>The battery drains faster than expected.</li>
                <li>There is an abundance of pop-up ads.</li>
                <li>Your phone has apps you don’t remember downloading.</li>
