        <p>{{ _('MFA refers to any type of authentication that requires two or more factors. That means that while 2FA is a form of MFA, not all forms of MFA have only two factors. Increasing the level of security by adding an extra factor makes it much more difficult for hackers to gain entry into a system.') }}</p>

        <p>{{ _('Two-factor authentication is important because adding an extra layer of verification before you can access your account means thieves will struggle to get your personal information. As cybercriminals continue to use brute force or password spraying attacks, even if you’re following good password security practices you need 2FA as well. It might seem like a hassle to add an extra step to your web surfing. But without it, you could be leaving yourself vulnerable to:') }}</p>

        <p>{{ _('If you add a knowledge factor to your bank account, a cybercriminal who knows your password due to a data breach or phishing operation won’t be able to access the account. This is because your phone will receive the verification code.') }}</p>
