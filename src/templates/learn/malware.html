        <h2>What is malware?<br/></h2>
        <p>Malware, short for &quot;malicious software,&quot; is any kind of <b>software designed to gain access to or damage a computer, usually without the owner's knowledge</b>. Originally, software engineers created malware for experiments and pranks. Eventually, ill-willed individuals found it useful for vandalism and the destruction of targeted machines.</p>

        <h2>How do you get malware?</h2>
        <p>Users get malware when a hacker infects a device; this process typically follows three general steps:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>A hacker strategically places a malicious link, file, or attachment in front of their victim, potentially as a phishing email or other social engineering scheme.</li>
        <li>The victim clicks on the infected asset, unknowingly triggering the malware to install onto their device.</li>
        <li>The malware proceeds to steal, compromise, and/or destroy sensitive data</a> stored on the device.<br />
        </li>
        </ol>

        <p>While you may download many kinds of malware from the internet, some hackers use USB sticks and flash drives to spread malware, because it’s harder for the system to detect infections that way. To avoid this tactic, never insert unfamiliar storage devices into your computer.</p>

        <h2>Common malware types <br/></h2>
        <p>There are many different kinds of malware lurking online. Here are 14 of the most common types of malware seen on the internet:</p>
